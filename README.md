# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning


## Overview
The Heart Disease Detection Project is a machine learning project developed using the Scikit-learn library. The primary goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various medical features.

## Objective
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and management. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to identify potential heart disease cases, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals.
